This file outlines resources for implementing rate limiting in Java and Golang applications.

### Rate Limiting Explained

Rate limiting controls the number of requests a user, application, or IP address can make within a specific time frame. This helps prevent abuse, protects resources, and ensures smooth system operation.

### Resources

- **Java:**
    - Rate Limiting Sample : [[Rate Limiting Sample](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/java-rate-limiting-pattern-sample)] (The objective is to establish a reliable and efficient integration between Azure API Management (APIM) and Service Bus for processing messages in a rate-limited manner. )
- **Golang:**
    - go-limiter: [[go-batcher](https://github.com/sethvargo/go-limiter)] (configurable rate limiting library)
