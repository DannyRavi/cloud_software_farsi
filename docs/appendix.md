on-premises:
In the on-premises model, your organization acquires and installs the software on on-premises data centers. Your organization’s internal IT deployment manages all the infrastructure required to use your software securely and at scale. For example, you would purchase and maintain server hardware. You’d also configure and update the operating systems that your software runs on, and you’d install and upgrade any required add-ons and plugins.
